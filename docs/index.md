Hi there :wave: I'm Matt! I'm a data enthusiast, who has worked as a data scientist :fontawesome-solid-microchip:, data engineer :fontawesome-solid-database:, data analyst :fontawesome-solid-chart-line:, and I've done just about every role regarding data. 

I love to share my findings and create visualizations to show what can be found and created from data. 

My experience includes handling data at every step in the data lifecycle for companies as large as fortune 50, and as small as 100 employees, from commercial retail data to medical device data used to save lives.

## Favorite projects
Some of these are available on my GitHub - others are not due to privacy concerns, sorry

#### Scooter :material-scooter:
A social media app built for Android, which is great for sharing text and image posts with friends. Includes sentiment analysis and document categorization, and optimized cloud caching

#### Lots of Options :fontawesome-solid-dollar-sign:
After trying to find historical options data and being unable to, I created a program that will download all options expirations available for >8,000 symbols, processes them in real time every minute, and stores the data in a compressed format. This is over 200gb of data a day being downloaded and processed instantly, don't tell my ISP.

#### Meleehub/SmashGifs :simple-falcon:
A duo of projects aimed at the classic game Super Smash Bros Melee - **MeleeHub** was a website that was meant to share replay files and analyze game data for AI, and **SmashGifs** is a discord bot that will automatically turn binary .slp replay files into video highlights given a timestamp.

#### EuchreAI :material-cards:
Euchre has less than half of a deck of cards, but is somehow more complicated than most card games. This project aimed to teach an AI to play via deep reinforcement learning. Also was a great lesson in pseudo and true random number generation.


## Articles

On the sidebar to the left, there are a few samples of articles available. 

The first one, [Exploring Medical Bills Across an Individual's Features](insurance_charges.md), focuses on a more journalistic style of writing and exploring data using a basic dataset with a limited number of features. The goal of this is to provide a sample of my writing and style, but to keep the read short.

The second article, [Analyzing Census Populations](census.ipynb), is a more in-depth and technical approach. This was not originally written with the intention of being shared as a journal article, but I thought it might be fun to provide here anyway and touch up a bit. The dataset has significantly more features and data, and more effort is spent on visualizing, predicting, and segmenting this data. If you have some time, it's an interesting read.
