Hi there :wave: I'm Matt! I'm a data enthusiast, who has worked as a data scientist :fontawesome-solid-microchip:, data engineer :fontawesome-solid-database:, data analyst :fontawesome-solid-chart-line:, and done just about every role regarding data. 

I love to share my findings and create visualizations to show what can be found and created from data. 

My experience includes handling data at every step in the data lifecycle for companies as large as fortune 50, and as small as 100 employees, from commercial retail data to medical device data used to save lives.
