It's another day in America - you wake up, enjoy some coffee to fight through that morning groginess, and crack open the paper. After your normal routine, it's time to start your day, and you head outside to warm your vehicle up to get to work. As you take your first step, the ground beneath you disappears and a sinkhole eats your entire right leg, then immediately closes. It looks like the ground has become sentient and has a craving for legs, but only right legs oddly enough. It happens so fast you can't react, but when your brain catches up with what is happening, you scramble away from the sinkhole. This isn't good - you need to go to the hospital, but the thought of that potential hospital bill makes you faint. After a moment, you regain consciousness and decide that it's ok; you have health insurance, and it can't be that bad. What does a sinkhole-bite replacement surgery cost, anyway? As your leg continues to bleed and you really need to get to the hospital, your curious nature continues to preoccupy you, and you can't help but wonder: do you know the price of *anything* at a hospital? Is there a way to know how much I'm going to pay before hand?

These are all great questions that an unfortunate number of Americans don't have the answer to. And while none of us are going to be eaten by a sentient sinkhole tomorrow (I hope), you never know what the day may bring, and if a hospital visit is included. Even more nebulous is the cost of that visit, both to your insurance provider, and what you end up with. Throughout this read, we're going to explore what factors about an individual relate to their average hospital charges, how well can we can predict these charges based off of those factors, and what you can do to help reduce your hospital bill charges.

### What data will we be using?

For this article, we'll be using a dataset from the book `Machine Learning with R by Brett Lantz` - specifically, this book provides a dataset that has medical billing data. The columns in this dataset contain an individual's `age`, `sex`, `bmi`, `number of children`, `smoker`, `region of the U.S.`, and the `amount their insurance was billed`. This dataset is relatively simple - it's purpose is almost entirely educational. This matches the purpose of this article, to explore the basics of data visualization and predictive modeling.
